## Project Overview

The Risk Assessment Engine is an AI-powered web application that enables
organisations to identify, classify, track and mitigate operational risks.
This repository contains the React frontend built during the internship
capstone sprint.

## My Contributions

### Day 1 — Frontend Project Setup
**Date:** Monday 20 April 2026
**Task:** Setup React with Vite — install Axios and Tailwind CSS,
set VITE_API_URL in .env, create pages/, components/, services/ folders

**Work completed:**
- Initialised React 18 project using Vite build tool
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v3 with PostCSS
- Configured Tailwind with project brand colour `#1B4F8A` and Arial font
- Installed Axios for HTTP communication with the backend API
- Installed React Router DOM for client-side navigation
- Created `.env` file and set `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api`
- Created all required folders as per project specification:
  - `src/pages/` — page-level components
  - `src/components/` — reusable UI components
  - `src/services/` — Axios API call functions
  - `src/context/` — React context providers
- Built `AuthContext.jsx` — manages JWT token, login, logout and
  authentication state across the entire application
- Built `ProtectedRoute.jsx` — prevents unauthenticated access,
  redirects to login page automatically
- Built `api.js` — central Axios instance with JWT request interceptor
  and global 401 unauthorised response handler
- Created service files:
  - `authService.js` — login, register, token refresh
  - `riskService.js` — full CRUD, search, stats, CSV export
  - `aiService.js` — all AI microservice endpoint calls
- Created placeholder components for all 6 pages
- Configured all application routes in `App.jsx`

### Day 2 — List View Page
**Date:** Tuesday 21 April 2026
**Task:** Build list view page — table with all columns, Axios GET on
mount, loading skeleton while fetching, empty state message

**Work completed:**
- Built complete `ListPage.jsx` — the main risk register data table
- Implemented Axios GET request on component mount to fetch all risks
  from the backend API
- **Table columns implemented:**
  - ID, Title, Category, Severity, Status, Risk Score, Owner,
    Created Date, Actions
- **Loading skeleton** — animated placeholder rows displayed while
  the API request is in progress
- **Empty state** — informative message displayed when no records
  exist or a search returns no results
- **Colour-coded severity badges:**
  - HIGH — red
  - MEDIUM — yellow
  - LOW — green
- **Colour-coded risk score display:**
  - Score 75 and above — red
  - Score 40 to 74 — yellow
  - Score below 40 — green
- **Column sorting** — click any sortable column header to sort
  ascending, click again to reverse to descending
- **Debounced text search** — 300ms delay prevents unnecessary API
  calls while the user is still typing
- **Status filter** — dropdown to filter records by OPEN, MITIGATED
  or CLOSED
- **Severity filter** — dropdown to filter records by HIGH, MEDIUM
  or LOW
- **Clear filters** — button appears automatically when any filter
  is active and resets all filters in one click
- **Pagination controls** — Previous and Next buttons with current
  page number and total pages displayed
- **CSV export** — downloads the full dataset as a CSV file directly
  in the browser
- Row click navigation — clicking any row navigates to the detail page
- Edit and View action buttons per row in the Actions column
- Error banner with Retry button displayed when the API call fails
- Fixed bug: `risks.filter is not a function` error on search
  - Cause: backend search endpoint returning inconsistent response shape
  - Fix: added safe array extraction to handle all possible API
    response structures

### Day 3 — Create and Edit Form Page
**Date:** Wednesday 22 April 2026
**Task:** Build create/edit form — controlled inputs for all fields,
client-side validation with inline error messages, submit handler

**Work completed:**
- Built complete `FormPage.jsx` — single component handles both
  create and edit modes
  - Create mode: accessed via `/risks/new`
  - Edit mode: accessed via `/risks/:id/edit`
  - Mode detected automatically using `useParams()`
- **Controlled input fields — all 9 fields:**
  - Risk Title — text input, max 200 characters with live counter
  - Description — textarea
  - Category — dropdown (Operational, Financial, Strategic,
    Compliance, Reputational, Technical, Other)
  - Severity — dropdown (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
  - Status — dropdown (OPEN, MITIGATED, CLOSED)
  - Risk Score — number input, range 0 to 100
  - Owner — text input
  - Mitigation Plan — textarea
  - Due Date — date picker
- **Form sections for structured layout:**
  - Basic Information
  - Classification
  - Score and Ownership
  - Mitigation
- **Client-side validation with inline error messages:**
  - Title: required, minimum 5 characters, maximum 200 characters
  - Description: required, minimum 10 characters
  - Category, Severity, Status: required selection
  - Risk Score: required, must be a number between 0 and 100
  - Owner: required
  - Due Date: cannot be set in the past
- Validation errors appear only after the user has interacted
  with a field — not on initial page load
- Fields re-validate in real time as the user types after first touch
- On form submit — all fields validate simultaneously with an
  error count summary displayed above the submit button
- **Live risk score indicator** — colour bar updates in real time
  as the score value is typed
  - 75 and above — red bar
  - 40 to 74 — yellow bar
  - 0 to 39 — green bar
- **Edit mode behaviour:**
  - Fetches existing record from API on page load
  - Displays animated skeleton while data is loading
  - Pre-populates all 9 fields with existing values
- Submit button displays a spinner animation during the API call
- Success banner displayed on completion with automatic redirect
  to the list page after 1.2 seconds
- Specific error messages for each HTTP failure type:
  - 401 — Session expired, please log in again
  - 403 — Access denied
  - 400 — Invalid data submitted
  - 404 — API endpoint not found
  - Network Error — Cannot reach the server
- Reset button on create form clears all fields and errors
- Fixed critical bug: input fields losing focus after every keystroke
  - Cause: `Field` wrapper component was defined inside `FormPage`,
    causing React to treat it as a new component on every state
    change and unmount and remount the input element
  - Fix: moved `Field` component definition to outside `FormPage`
    so React preserves the component instance across renders

## Issues Resolved

| Day | Issue | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | `npx tailwindcss init -p` failing with npm error | Tailwind v4 changed the initialisation command and is incompatible with this project setup | Installed `tailwindcss@3` explicitly |
| Day 2 | `risks.filter is not a function` crash when using search | Backend search endpoint returning an object instead of an array in some cases | Added defensive array extraction logic to handle all possible response shapes from the API |
| Day 3 | All input fields losing focus after typing a single character | `Field` wrapper component was defined inside `FormPage`, causing React to create a new component type on every state update and unmount the focused input | Moved `Field` component definition to module scope outside `FormPage` |
